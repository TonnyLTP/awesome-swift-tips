 Extension conflicts with 'Self' when extending Entity, but you know Protocol in Swift welcomes 'Self'. I wish I'm the last person in the earth known it.
 
 In Chinese culture, Dao describes a fairyland where nothing is everything, everything is nothing. It's empty but rich, it's still but transformable.
 How about using Dao transform logic features into entities?
